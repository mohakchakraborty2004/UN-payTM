The thing i made is a "cLoNe" of paytm which i named un-paytm.


If anyone is looking at this project then please note the following down :


 1. ``` this project covers the major aspects i.e JWTs , Atomicity in database, authorization techniques. ```
 2. ``` If you find anything missing in this project, feel free to clone and study the code and make your changes, and if you do any prs , i may or may not entertain them since i am not considering it that "level" of project.  ```
 3. ``` major drawback - I haven't used any .env file to hide the jwt secrets or the mongodb url, if i get time to do this in future i'll update it , so i have left empty spaces there.  ```
 4. ``` In some places the code is hardcoded , the frontend bit ofcourse , and obv that comes under the missing things mentioned in point 2 .```


 well this was my first mern project which helped me understanding some basics , built it over a span of 7 to 8 days , THANKS!
